    "question": "Two teams of movers are lowering a piano from the window of a 10-floor apartment building. The rope breaks when the piano is 30 meters above the ground. The movers on the ground, alerted by the shouts of the movers above, first notice the piano when it is 14 meters above the ground. How long do they have to get out of the way before the piano hits the ground?",
